## Hi, I'm Taylor!

<!--
**drtclem/drtclem** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Focused on building meaningful, data-driven solutions in education, healthcare, and biotech. Skilled in Python, ML modeling (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, MobileNetV2), and data storytelling through visualization. I thrive on solving complex problems that matterâ€”whether itâ€™s aligning education with real-world needs or leveraging machine learning for health impact.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
	â€¢	Image classification using MobileNetV2
	â€¢	Predictive modeling for education & healthcare data

ðŸ“„ About me:
I believe the best insights come from asking the right questions. With a background rooted in research and a drive to make data science more accessible and practical, I work on projects that blend technical rigor with real-world relevance. From investigating the calculus pipeline in education to training neural networks for medical image classification, I approach data like a puzzleâ€”with curiosity, care, and a bias toward action.

Letâ€™s connect and build something impactful.
